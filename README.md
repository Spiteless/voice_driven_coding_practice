# Voice Driven Coding Practice

I've been learning to use Talon Voice, this repo will only have code I've added with while voice coding

## Notes for voice coding as per community review
- VSCode search links that have appeared in the terminal
  - please terminal open
  - can map to direct voice command eg (termianl hunt {phrase})
- bring {TOKEN} to every instance collie {TOKEN} {!!}
  - this would select foo.bar in foo.bar(args)
- try and use the `that` keyword to run commands easier later
